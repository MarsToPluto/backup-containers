# Docker Container Backup Script Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the Docker container backup script. The script is designed to facilitate the backup of Docker container contents to a specified directory. It offers dynamic handling of container names, user input for inclusion or exclusion, and robust error handling.

## Features

- **Dynamic Container Listing**: Automatically fetches the list of running Docker containers.
- **User Configuration**: Allows users to specify which containers to include or exclude in the backup.
- **Directory Management**: Creates necessary backup directories if they do not already exist.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback on any issues encountered during the backup process.
- **Backup Status**: Displays the location where backups are stored upon completion.

## Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed and running on the system.
- Sufficient permissions to access Docker and create directories.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Save the Script**: Save the provided script to a file, e.g., `backup.sh`.

2. **Set Executable Permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backup.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./backup.sh
   ```

4. **Follow Prompts**:
   - The script will prompt you to enter container names for inclusion or exclusion. Provide comma-separated lists or leave fields empty to include all containers or exclude none.

5. **Verify Backup**:
   - After completion, check the specified backup directory to confirm the backup files.

## Configuration Options

- **Backup Directory**: Specify the directory where backups will be stored.
- **Include List**: Enter container names to include in the backup.
- **Exclude List**: Enter container names to exclude from the backup.

## Error Handling

- **Permission Denied**: Ensure the script has the necessary permissions to execute. Use `chmod` to adjust permissions if needed.
- **Container Not Running**: The script will notify if a specified container is not running or does not exist.
- **Backup Failure**: Any issues during the backup process will be reported, specifying the affected container.

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is running before executing the script.
- Modify the backup directory path if a different location is required.

## Backup Directory Location

Upon completion, the backup files will be stored in the specified directory. The script will display the backup directory location for reference.
